When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    * When working in several locations/computers
    * When developing in team
    * When releasing code to others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    * To share only when your commit HEAD reachs certain conditions (tested, completeness, ...)
    * To commit offline

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    off-line availability
